# Google Search Parser #
## Simple Project to Examine Your Google Search History ##
##### Matt Ritter, April 2015 ###$$
In January, Google made it possible for you to download all of your search results. Google attaches search results to a given Google account. This product provides a simple mechanism for viewing those results.

To download your results, go to history.google.com/history. Sign in, click the gear in the top right corner, and click download. Google will email you with a zip file of your history.

Take the "Searches" directory and put it into this project directory. The directory must be named "Searches". Run "python searches.py" to visualize your data!

This product requires MongoDB and Pymongo.
